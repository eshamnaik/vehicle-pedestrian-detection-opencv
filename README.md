## ❓ ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project is a real-time object detection system that identifies vehicles and pedestrians in video footage using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifiers. It's a beginner-friendly project to understand how basic object tracking works using frame-by-frame video processing.

## 🛠️ HOW TO RUN

1. Clone the Repository and Install Requirements

git clone https://github.com/eshamnaik/vehicle-pedestrian-detection-opencv.git   
cd vehicle-pedestrian-detection-opencv  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python main.py  
---  
 🔍 WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE OUTPUT  

✅ This is what happens after running the script:**  

🟢 **Code finishes successfully after:** `python main.py`    
📽️ The video will display frame-by-frame, with object detection.)  
🔴 **Red Boxes** → Detected **Vehicles**   
🟡 **Yellow Boxes** → Detected **Pedestrians**
