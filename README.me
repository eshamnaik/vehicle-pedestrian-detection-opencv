🚗 VEHICLE AND PEDESTRIAN DETECTION USING OPENCV

❓ ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project is a real-time object detection system that identifies vehicles and pedestrians in video footage using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifiers. It's a beginner-friendly project to understand how basic object tracking works using frame-by-frame video processing.

✅ OBJECT DETECTION USING HAAR CASCADE

Haar Cascade Classifiers are trained from lots of positive and negative images:

Positive images: Contain the objects we want to detect (e.g., cars or humans).

Negative images: Contain anything but the object of interest.

OpenCV has many pre-trained Haar XML files which can detect various objects. In this project, we use the XML files for cars and pedestrians.

🔖 SETUP & USAGE

Step 1: Clone the Repo

git clone https://github.com/eshamnaik/vehicle-pedestrian-detection-opencv.git
cd vehicle-pedestrian-detection-opencv

Step 2: Install Required Packages

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Run the Script

Make sure the video and XML files are in their respective folders.

python main.py

🎥 RESULT SNAPSHOT
