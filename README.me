# 🚗🚶 Vehicle and Pedestrian Detection Using OpenCV

This is a simple computer vision project that detects cars and pedestrians in a video using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers.

## 🔍 Why I Built This

I was curious about how object detection works in real-time — especially in things like CCTV, traffic systems, and autonomous vehicles. So, I built this to experiment and understand how detection really happens behind the scenes.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main Python script for detection
- `haarcascades/`: Contains XML classifiers (`cars.xml` and `haarcascade_fullbody.xml`)
- `Dataset (Sample Videos)/`: Video file folder (`my_video.mp4`)
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for this project

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
